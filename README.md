In this project, a labyrinth board game called "End of the Labyrinth" was designed.

The game story comes from Greek Mythology. Therefore, our characters consist of Greek Mythology characters with different advantages and disadvantages. It can be played by two 
to four people. Game area is a labyrinth full of monsters, obstacles and loot. Aim of the players is to be the first person that arrived to the final room. In the final room, Minotaur lives and there will be a fight between player and him. The winner of the game will be the one who can defeat the Minotaur, which has these different characteristics and powers.
